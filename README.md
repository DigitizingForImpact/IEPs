# Impact Enhancement Proposals (IEPs)

Use `IEPs` as the canonical source of accepted proposals in Digitizing for Impact. Impact Enancement Proposals document Digital Monitoring, Reporting (MRV) and Verification Methodologies.

The repository is organized in three branches:  
- `main` contains the final, approved and published copy of an IEP.
This is the canonical source of the document and a permanent hyperlink can be made to any document on the main branch.

- `drafts` contains IEPs traveling the submission, review and approval workflows.

- `infa` contains scripts, tools and miscellaneous files IEP administrators use to maintain the repository.

## Start Here
- `IEP-0` is a digest of all IEPs, final and draft.
- `IEP-1` contains policy, guidance governing the IEP approval process.
